### The Study

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

The first poem explains how the couplets work. For each couplet, the first line describes a word and the second line describes another word that can be formed by adding an extra letter. For example, CAR -> CARE or BET -> BEAT.

</p>
</details>

Each couplet yields a single letter that is from the added letter.

</p>

### The Solarium

<details><summary>Clue for Card I.</summary>
<p>

Do you see the pattern of leaves on another card? Can you match them up to decode the message on Card I?

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue for Card II.</summary>
<p>

By following the instructions given on the card, there are four additional plots where roses must go when following the rules. Extract those four letters.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue for Card III.</summary>
<p>

Solve the crossword, and take the letters where there is a leaf in the box. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue for Card IV.</summary>
<p>

Each of the four symbols represents a different letter. The word you are looking for is at the top in the rectangle. The other 6 words underneath help you figure out what letters the symbols represent. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue for the overall puzzle</summary>
<p>

The Solarium puzzle is a bit different in that you need to solve mini-puzzles in order to get a message, which then allows you to extract a word that is the lock combination. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer part 1</summary>
<p>

The four cards reveal the phrase MAKE FOUR LEAF CLOVER. Using the backs of the cards, make a four leaf clover (there is approximately a quarter of the clover on each card).

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer part 2</summary>
<p>

After making the clover, flip the four cards around. The vines create a circle around the word. The answer is CLAY.

</p>
</details>

### The Bedrooms

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

Look at the underlined words. Can you turn them into a phrase? The bolded word "reversals" may also give a clue.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

From clue 1, you should have the phrase "shift forward by your age." Since Reager wrote this letter to her brother Alfred, you need to figure out Alfred's age when he received the letter. The scratchings on the wall and the letter itself should help.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

The bolded word "Capital" provides a clue of what to shift. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 4</summary>
<p>

After shifting forward all the capitals by 19 and figuring out where words begin & end, you should reveal the phrase TO HAVE BEEN ALIVE BACKWARDS. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

The definition of "LIVED" fits "to have been alive." Backwards, it spells DEVIL, which is the answer.

</p>
</details>

### The Kitchen

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

You are looking for 6 numbers that correspond to the recipe.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Use #3 and #10 together to figure out the number of eggs and the ounces of butter.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

Use #2, #4 and the fact that you know what eggs and butter are in order to figure out the ounces of flour. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 4</summary>
<p>

Use #2, #5, #6, and #8 to begin narrowing down the possibilities for the other four amounts. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 5</summary>
<p>

Use #9. Because all amounts are between 1-20, you can get a quick minimum and maximum sum that the amounts can be. You should get only two possible numbers for the ounces of sugar that fit the sum's range. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 6</summary>
<p>

Now using #7, you can guess and check to see which of the two options is correct. Only one outcome works for #7 and #9. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

The amounts are 1, 7, 8, 1 19, 20. Changing those to letters (where A=1 and Z=26) yields the answer AGHAST.

</p>
</details>

### The Dining Room

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

The napkin's patterns are very symmetrical, which may give you a hint for how your folds should be.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Do you know how to fold a cootie catcher? The answer is similar.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

After folding into a 2x2 such that only red is showing, the napkin should reveal two letters on each side. HU and NT spells out the answer HUNT. 

</p>
</details>

## Part 1

### Newspaper Clipping

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

The ad on the back and the newspaper's tagline both give a clue for what is very strange about each of the four articles.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Each of the four articles uses long-winded phrases in lieu of a common word.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

The common words that are not used all are homophones. Can you figure out of what? 

</p>
</details>
 
<details><summary>Clue 4</summary>
<p>

Once you get a word from the four newspaper articles, you need to figure out which location on the map best fits the word. You may want to consider synonyms.

</p>
</details>

### Ciphertext and circular keys

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

Use 1 key at a time with the ciphertext.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Rotate each key until you are able to see a word appear based on the lines that are fully connected.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

Each key gives a word. All three keys reveal a phrase that refers to a location on the map.

</p>
</details>

### Photos

<p>

You'll likely need to use the Internet to do some sleuthing and figure out the landmarks.

</p>
</details>

<p>

Each of the photos reveals a famous landmark in England.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

What is in the photo may look slightly different from the present day.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 4</summary>
<p>

Each landmark's name consists of two words. Take the common letters between the two words (each photo yields 1-2 common letters).

</p>
</details>

### Bill of fare

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

Study the dishes and their corresponding prices together.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Each dish and price pair results in a part of the answer. The name of the restaurant may provide a clue for what to do.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

The 's' and 'd' stand for old currencies that was used in Britain during this time period.
