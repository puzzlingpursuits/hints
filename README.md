## How many golden rings?

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

The dates given are the twelve days of Christmas. The question is based off the song, "The Twelve Days of Christmas." 
 
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

On the fifth day of Christmas, the true love gifts five golden rings. The song then continues on through days six through day twelve, and on each day, the true love continues to gift five golden rings.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

From the 5th to the 12th days of Christmas (8 days in total), the true love gifts 5 rings on each day. The total is 8 x 5 = 40 golden rings.

</p>
</details>
 
 ## Security Hub
 
<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

Look at main line B. There are 6 lines exiting it (3 towards the top and 3 towards the right), which means it must be the main line for the Pole Exterior, the only area with 6 cameras.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Look at the two pipes towards the top of the image that are connected by a differently colored line. Use the second note: this is how the elves connected the dormitories to the kitchen. Since the Dormitories only has 3 cameras, the branched line on the left with 4 lines cannot be for the Dormitories. So, the one on the left must be for the Kitchen, and the one on the right must be for the Dormitories.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

Look at main lines A and F. They both go into a grey box, and one of the lines exiting the box is for the Dormitories. So, either A or F is the main line for the Dormitories.

The Dormitories has 3 cameras. If main line A was for the Dormitories, all 3 lines exiting would have to be from A, which means that F ends in the grey box. However, it is not possible for a line to end in a grey box. Therefore, the main line F must be the Dormitories.
 
The main line F already has 1 line branching off of it before the grey box, so to be the Dormitories with 3 cameras, F must also branch into 2 lines exiting the grey box. This means that A has one exiting line, so A has 1 camera.
 
Consequently, F is the Dormitories and A is the Sleigh Hangar.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 4</summary>
<p>

Look at main lines C, D, and E which all feed into the other grey box. There are 3 lines exiting the grey box. Since no line can end in the box, each line exiting must belong to one main line.
 
The 4 branches at the top go to the Kitchen, from Clue 2. Since the Kitchen has 5 cameras, the main line must provide 1 extra branch to get to 5. Before the grey box, C has 0 branches, D has 1 branch, and E has 2 branches. So, D must be for the Kitchen.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 5</summary>
<p>

That leaves main lines C and E. By deciding which of the remaining two exiting lines belong to C and D, you can pair them up to main lines that branch to 3 and 4 cameras or main lines that branch to 5 and 2 cameras.
 
Since only the Stables (3 cameras) and Toy Workshop (4 cameras) are left, main line C must branch to 3 cameras and E must branch to 4 cameras.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

The answer is AFCEDB.
 
Sleigh Hangar: A<br>
Dormitories: F<br>
Stables: C<br>
Toy Workshop: E<br>
Kitchen: D<br>
Pole Exterior: B<br>

</details>


## Kitchen

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

Start with the materials in the journal, the Christmas tree drawing with a message on it and the alphabet. The message is encoded by the drawing - can you figure out how?

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Notice that the number of ornaments on the tree and the number of letters in the message are the same.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

Pay attention to the color and shape of each ornament. Looking at how the alphabet is written out may also help you figure out a pattern. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 4</summary>
<p>

Each row in the alphabet corresponds to the different ornament shape. Each column in the alphabet corresponds to a different color. So, each letter is uniquely identified by a particular ornament shape and color combination.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 5</summary>
<p>

Use the pattern you've figured out from the materials in the journal to decode the new message. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

The encoded message is BRAN FLAKES AT DROP.

</p>
</details>

## Laser Maze

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

Look at the materials in the journal. See if you can figure out a connection between the square pattern at the top and the laser configurations.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Try out some ideas by moving Tinsel around. Most spaces won't work but if you find one that does, it will provide additional information on which squares are safe to step on.
 
Also, notice that the patterns always start and end at the top, middle, or bottom of the square. This mirrors the fact that there are 3 teddy bears on the left and 3 teddy bears on the right.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

There are 5 columns in the laser maze and 5 square patterns, one above each column. This suggests that when you step on a tile in a particular column, the laser configuration you get is the pattern above that column.
 
The first tile Tinsel should go to is D. The second tile is C.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 4</summary>
<p>

At this point, you should know how to determine exactly where each teddy bear's laser is pointing. Each teddy bear corresponds to a point on the square (top/middle/bottom and left/right). If there's a line away from that point going diagonal, then the teddy bear's laser is also pointing diagonally in the same direction. Otherwise, the teddy bear's laser is pointing straight across.
 
Using this information, you can figure out which tiles are safe to step on ahead of time.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 5</summary>
<p>

To reach the end, you may have to go backwards and across before you can keep going towards the other side.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

The sequence to get to the other side is: D, C, A, H, G, A, A, B, D, C.

</p>
</details>

## Toy Sentinel

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

Try to figure out which pieces go in the center, the corners, and the middle edges. You can do this for each piece by figuring out how many sides have wires that leave it.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

The piece that looks like a grid must be in the center, because all four sides have wires that leave it.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

Now figure out how each piece connects based on if there are 1 or 2 wires that leave it.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer for the Circuit</summary>
<p>

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue for the Wire Cutting</summary>
<p>

Look at the complete circuit diagram and the orientation of the battery. The motherboard is the green, square component because the others correspond to the battery, the goo gun, and the bat.

</p>
</details>


<details><summary>Answer for the Wire Cutting</summary>
<p>

The answer is the top wire.

</p>
</details>

## The Penguin Lock

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

Look at the map and strip of paper in the journal. The strip of paper contains unique mountains that appear just once in the map. Can you think of a way they can correspond to which letter to press for the lock?

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

The lock has 8 keys. They are divided around a circle similar to how a compass has various directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

There is a penguin both in the map and on the lock. Imagine that you are going through the list of 7 mountains on the strip of paper from the penguins point of view (not from a birds-eye map view). Which directions would you take to get to each of the 7 mountains?

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 4</summary>
<p>

The first two letters are R and E.
 
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

The passcode is REVENGE.
 
</p>
</details>


## Which Santa

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

You will need to use information you've been told earlier in the game about Nick and Terry.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Look back at the original email that Pip sent. Read how she described Terry.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

Look closely at each twin's facial features with the looking glass. Do you see something on one of them that you'd only find on Nick but not on Terry? 

</p>
</details>
 
<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

The twin on the left is Nick, because there are cookie crumbs in his beard. Terry hates cookies so would never eat them.

Congratulations, you're nearly there!
