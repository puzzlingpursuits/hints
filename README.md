</p>
</details>

</p>
</details>

## How many golden rings?

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

The dates given are the twelve days of Christmas. The question is based off the song, "The Twelve Days of Christmas." 
 
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

On the fifth day of Christmas, the true love gifts five golden rings. The song then continues on through days six through day twelve, and on each day, the true love continues to gift five golden rings.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

From the 5th to the 12th days of Christmas (8 days in total), the true love gifts 5 rings on each day. The total is 8 x 5 = 40 golden rings.

</p>
</details>
 
 ## Security Camera
 
<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

Look at main line B. There are 6 lines exiting it (3 towards the top and 3 towards the right), which means it must be the main line for the Pole Exterior, the only area with 6 cameras.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Look at the two pipes towards the top of the image that are connected by a differently colored line. Use the second note: this is how the elves connected the dormitories to the kitchen. Since the Dormitories only has 3 cameras, the branched line on the left with 4 lines cannot be for the Dormitories. So, the one on the left must be for the Kitchen, and the one on the right must be for the Dormitories.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

Look at main lines A and F. They both go into a grey box, and one of the lines exiting the box is for the Dormitories. So, either A or F is the main line for the Dormitories.

The Dormitories has 3 cameras. If main line A was for the Dormitories, all 3 lines exiting would have to be from A, which means that F ends in the grey box. However, it is not possible for a line to end in a grey box. Therefore, the main line F must be the Dormitories.
 
The main line F already has 1 line branching off of it before the grey box, so to be the Dormitories with 3 cameras, F must also branch into 2 lines exiting the grey box. This means that A has one exiting line, so A has 1 camera.
 
Consequently, F is the Dormitories and A is the Sleigh Hangar.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 4</summary>
<p>

Look at main lines C, D, and E which all feed into the other grey box. There are 3 lines exiting the grey box. Since no line can end in the box, each line exiting must belong to one main line.
 
The 4 branches at the top go to the Kitchen, from Clue 2. Since the Kitchen has 5 cameras, the main line must provide 1 extra branch to get to 5. Before the grey box, C has 0 branches, D has 1 branch, and E has 2 branches. So, D must be for the Kitchen.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 5</summary>
<p>

That leaves main lines C and E. By deciding which of the remaining two exiting lines belong to C and D, you can pair them up to main lines that branch to 3 and 4 cameras or main lines that branch to 5 and 2 cameras.
 
Since only the Stables (3 cameras) and Toy Workshop (4 cameras) are left, main line C must branch to 3 cameras and E must branch to 4 cameras.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

The answer is AFCEDB.
 
Sleigh Hangar: A
Dormitories: F
Stables: C
Toy Workshop: E
Kitchen: D
Pole Exterior: B

### The Solarium

<details><summary>Clue for Card I.</summary>
<p>

Do you see the pattern of leaves on another card? Can you match them up to decode the message on Card I?

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue for Card II.</summary>
<p>

By following the instructions given on the card, there are four additional plots where roses must go when following the rules. Extract those four letters.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue for Card III.</summary>
<p>

Solve the crossword, and take the letters where there is a leaf in the box. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue for Card IV.</summary>
<p>

Each of the four symbols represents a different letter. The word you are looking for is at the top in the rectangle. The other 6 words underneath help you figure out what letters the symbols represent. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue for the overall puzzle</summary>
<p>

The Solarium puzzle is a bit different in that you need to solve mini-puzzles in order to get a message, which then allows you to extract a word that is the lock combination. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer part 1</summary>
<p>

The four cards reveal the phrase MAKE FOUR LEAF CLOVER. Using the backs of the cards, make a four leaf clover (there is approximately a quarter of the clover on each card).

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer part 2</summary>
<p>

After making the clover, flip the four cards around. The vines create a circle around the word. The answer is CLAY.

</p>
</details>

### The Bedrooms

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

Look at the underlined words. Can you turn them into a phrase? The bolded word "reversals" may also give a clue.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

From clue 1, you should have the phrase "shift forward by your age." Since Reager wrote this letter to her brother Alfred, you need to figure out Alfred's age when he received the letter. The scratchings on the wall and the letter itself should help.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

The bolded word "Capital" provides a clue of what to shift. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 4</summary>
<p>

After shifting forward all the capitals by 19 and figuring out where words begin & end, you should reveal the phrase TO HAVE BEEN ALIVE BACKWARDS. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

The definition of "LIVED" fits "to have been alive." Backwards, it spells DEVIL, which is the answer.

</p>
</details>

### The Kitchen

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

You are looking for 6 numbers that correspond to the recipe.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Use #3 and #10 together to figure out the number of eggs and the ounces of butter.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

Use #2, #4 and the fact that you know what eggs and butter are in order to figure out the ounces of flour. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 4</summary>
<p>

Use #2, #5, #6, and #8 to begin narrowing down the possibilities for the other four amounts. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 5</summary>
<p>

Use #9. Because all amounts are between 1-20, you can get a quick minimum and maximum sum that the amounts can be. You should get only two possible numbers for the ounces of sugar that fit the sum's range. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 6</summary>
<p>

Now using #7, you can guess and check to see which of the two options is correct. Only one outcome works for #7 and #9. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

The amounts are 1, 7, 8, 1 19, 20. Changing those to letters (where A=1 and Z=26) yields the answer AGHAST.

</p>
</details>

### The Dining Room

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

The napkin's patterns are very symmetrical, which may give you a hint for how your folds should be.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Do you know how to fold a cootie catcher? The answer is similar.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

After folding into a 2x2 such that only red is showing, the napkin should reveal two letters on each side. HU and NT spells out the answer HUNT. 

</p>
</details>

## Part 1

### Newspaper Clipping

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

The ad on the back and the newspaper's tagline both give a clue for what is very strange about each of the four articles.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Each of the four articles uses long-winded phrases in lieu of a common word.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

The common words that are not used all are homophones. Can you figure out of what? 

</p>
</details>
 
<details><summary>Clue 4</summary>
<p>

Once you get a word from the four newspaper articles, you need to figure out which location on the map best fits the word. You may want to consider synonyms.

</p>
</details>

### Ciphertext and circular keys

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

Use 1 key at a time with the ciphertext.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Rotate each key until you are able to see a word appear based on the lines that are fully connected.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

Each key gives a word. All three keys reveal a phrase that refers to a location on the map.

</p>
</details>

### Photos

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

You'll likely need to use the Internet to do some sleuthing and figure out the landmarks.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Each of the photos reveals a famous landmark in England.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

What is in the photo may look slightly different from the present day.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 4</summary>
<p>

Each landmark's name consists of two words. Take the common letters between the two words (each photo yields 1-2 common letters).

</p>
</details>

### Bill of fare

<details><summary>Clue 1</summary>
<p>

Study the dishes and their corresponding prices together.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 2</summary>
<p>

Each dish and price pair results in a part of the answer. The name of the restaurant may provide a clue for what to do.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Clue 3</summary>
<p>

The 's' and 'd' stand for old currencies that was used in Britain during this time period.

</p>
</details>
